# springboot-backend

## Overview

Our Spring Boot project utilizes Spring Data JPA for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the MySQL database.
Spring Data JPA simplifies the data access layer by providing a set of abstractions to work with relational databases using JPA.

## ORM Implementation

### Entity Classes

We have defined several entity classes that map to database tables using JPA annotations like @Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue, etc.
These entity classes represent the domain model of our application.

### Repository Interfaces

Spring Data JPA provides repository interfaces that extend `JpaRepository` or `CrudRepository`. 
These interfaces allow us to perform CRUD operations on the database without writing boilerplate code.

## Data Processing

### Service Layer

We have implemented a service layer that contains business logic and interacts with the repository layer to fetch or manipulate data.
