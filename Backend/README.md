# Backend

Welcome to the backend folder of our application. This directory houses all the server-side logic, including routes, models, configuration files, utilities, and package management.

## Package Files

### package-lock.json
package-lock.json is a file generated by npm that locks down the versions of all installed dependencies. It ensures that subsequent installations of dependencies use the exact same versions to maintain consistency across different environments.

### package.json
package.json is the manifest file for the backend server. It contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, description, author, and license. Additionally, it lists all the dependencies required by the project, along with their versions and other relevant information.


## Routes

### AdminRoute.js
This file defines routes and controllers for administrative tasks, such as managing users with administrative privileges, system settings, and other related functionalities.

### EmployeeRoute.js
EmployeeRoute.js contains route definitions and handlers for various employee-related operations, including CRUD operations for employee data, managing leaves, payroll, tasks, and other functionalities specific to employees.

## Config

### config.json
config.json stores configuration settings for the backend server. It typically includes details like database connection strings, API keys, environment variables, and other settings necessary for the application to function properly.

## Models

The models directory contains Sequelize models for interacting with the database. Each model represents a database table and encapsulates the logic for querying and manipulating data.

- **admin.js**: Model for managing admin users and permissions.
- **announcement.js**: Model for handling announcements that are displayed to users.
- **benefits.js**: Model for managing employee benefits, such as insurance, retirement plans, etc.
- **category.js**: Model for categorizing different entities within the system.
- **certifications.js**: Model for managing employee certifications and qualifications.
- **department.js**: Model for managing organizational departments.
- **employee.js**: Model representing individual employees, containing their personal and professional information.
- **employee_meets.js**: Model for tracking employee meetings and appointments.
- **employee_trainers.js**: Model for managing employee training sessions and trainers.
- **healthservice.js**: Model for managing health services offered to employees.
- **help_support.js**: Model for handling user inquiries and support requests.
- **index.js**: Entry point for exporting all models.
- **leaves.js**: Model for managing employee leave requests and approvals.
- **meets.js**: Model for scheduling and managing meetings.
- **payroll.js**: Model for processing employee salaries and related financial transactions.
- **tasks.js**: Model for managing tasks assigned to employees.
- **training_modes.js**: Model for defining different modes of training available to employees.

## Node Modules

This directory contains all the dependencies installed for the backend server. These dependencies are managed by npm and are listed in the package.json file.

## Utils

### db.js
db.js contains utility functions for interacting with the database. It provides functions for connecting to the database, executing queries, handling transactions, and other database-related operations.

### sequelize.js
sequelize.js is a wrapper module that abstracts the usage of Sequelize ORM. It encapsulates common Sequelize operations, making it easier to interact with the database without exposing Sequelize-specific details throughout the codebase.


## Documentation of the Implementation Process of Sequelize ORM and Database Migrations
1. Project Description
Our project is a system for employee management, developed in a Node.js environment with a MySQL database. We chose Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to facilitate our access to the database and to manage database migrations.

2.  Choice of Sequelize as ORM and MySQL as Database
The choice of Sequelize as ORM and MySQL as the database was made for several reasons:

Node.js Compatibility: Sequelize is a powerful and suitable ORM for projects developed in Node.js.
Support for MySQL: Sequelize offers built-in support for MySQL, which is a widely used and reliable database.
Community and Documentation: Sequelize has a large community and rich documentation, allowing us to quickly find solutions to challenges we may encounter during the implementation and management of the ORM in our project.
3. Sequelize ORM Implementation Process
The process of implementing Sequelize ORM in our project involves the following key steps:

Installation of Sequelize and MySQL Driver: Initially, Sequelize and the MySQL driver are installed in our project via npm.
Sequelize Configuration: We configure Sequelize to connect our application to the MySQL database. This includes configuring the connection parameters in the config/config.json file.
Definition of Models: Next, models are defined for the data in the database. Models define the structure and relationships between different tables in the database.
Reading and Writing Data: Using Sequelize allows us to read and write data from and to the database through the defined models.
4. Database Migrations
To manage changes in the database structure, we use database migrations. These migrations are used to create, alter, or delete tables, columns, or indexes in the database. Using migrations ensures a structured and safe process for applying changes to the database without risking existing data.

5. Decisions Made during the Development Process
During the development of the project, we made several important technical decisions, such as:

Choice of Sequelize and MySQL: The choice of Sequelize as ORM and MySQL as the database was made due to their compatibility with our project and our previous experience with them.
Model Structure: We decided to separate the models into separate files to keep our code organized and facilitate access to them.
Database Migrations: We decided to use database migrations to ensure that changes to the database structure are successfully applied without risking existing data.
These decisions were made taking into account the specific needs of our project and our previous experience in the field of application development.

This document describes the process of implementing Sequelize ORM and database migrations in our project, including technical details and decisions made during the development process.
